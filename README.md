### Hi there 👋

#### About me

[![Pronouns she/her](https://img.shields.io/badge/pronouns-she%2Fher-9cf)](https://pronoun.is/she)

I'm an SRE with a background in systems and software engineering. I am a Senior Software Engineer at [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/careers/) and was previously the Tech Lead and Staff Engineer on Rent the Runway's Infrastructure team, working on building out our cloud infrastructure and revamping our CI/CD pipelines. I enjoy big-picture projects, doing things right the first time, leaving things better than I found them, and working with awesome, ambitious people who love what they do as much as I do.

I'm a huge fan of automation and optimization. I'm trying to blog more. Go is my favorite programming language, after bash of course. I think it's time to learn a new language... Rust?

#### Projects

##### `woke`

🌟 Check out my new open source project, [`woke`](https://github.com/get-woke/woke), which is a text file analysis tool that detects non-inclusive language in your source code. 
👩‍💻 Read my blog post about why I created `woke` and why you should use it on [Rent the Runway's Tech Blog](https://dresscode.renttherunway.com/blog/woke).

##### Trivia

❓❓❓ In this everything-Zoom world right now, I was looking for a way to stay connected to others, and have fun at the same time. I have really enjoyed the gameplay of JackBox games (everyone can play remotely on their phones with one person hosting) and was interested in building something similar. 🙋🏽‍♀️ So I built a trivia game in React that runs on WebRTC/[PeerJS](https://github.com/peers/peerjs-server) and gets trivia questions from [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/). 

💰 It's free and relies only on GitHub pages, OpenTDB, and a PeerJS server. Go to <https://triviawithfriends.fun> to play now!
